# Learn Javascript

## Let's hit the JS playground

### Don't be a noob

Java is not Javascript.
Okay, now you're ready to begin... ðŸ˜›

### Try JS out

The easiest way to dip your toes in the pool of JS is in a coding fiddle. Let's use [Codepen](codepen.io)

Set up a [new pen in Codepen](codepen.io/pen)

#### Steps shown above:

* slide the JS section up
* open the console (bottom left)
* give you pen a name (top left)
* click "Save" ([create your FREE account if you haven't already](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free))

Copy this code into your new pen in the JS block/section:

```javascript
// store info about our user
let name = "Molly",
  age = "forever young";

// build message
let statement = `${name} is ${age}`;

// put message into console
console.log(statement);
```

You should be looking something like this:
